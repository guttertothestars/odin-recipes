  <h2>Gin Cocktail</h2>
  <p>A true classic with strict rules</p>
  <h2> Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>  
    <li>3 oz London dry gin</li>
    <li>1/2 oz dry vermouth</li>
    <li>2-3 green olives</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <p>if you still have any vodka from the previous cocktails throw it away. It 
    has no place here.</p>
  <p>If you have any of those nouveau floral gins throw them away too. Your gin 
    should taste like you've made out with a pine tree.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Add the gin and vermouth to a mixing glass filled with ice and stir 
      until well-chilled.</li>
    <li>Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.</li>
    <li>Garnish with a skewer of olives. </li>
  </ol>
